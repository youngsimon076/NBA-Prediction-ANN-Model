This is a rudimentary ANN made in python that can predict NBA games.
It has a success rate of ~68% on the training data, not 100% sure how accurate it is on future predictions but it should be very close.
Use https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_games-march.html to select "rows" of games, keep in mind that BR has games in groups of 20 so that should make it easier to find which rows you're looking for.
